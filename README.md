 *Access the myuplink API*

 [myuplink.com](https://myuplink.com) operates a cloud for energy related IoTs, such as heat pumps. Access is granted through an [API]((https://dev.myuplink.com). This is a small python script that implements authentication through OAuth and allows reading parameters. 

 A lot of info came from https://www.marshflattsfarm.org.uk/wordpress/?page_id=5235

The provided script is fairly self explanatory. It does require a web server answering the call of the authentication system. The provided php script is a simple version for that.
